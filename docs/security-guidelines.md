# Kyndly ICHRA Portal Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security measures, best practices, and compliance requirements for the Kyndly ICHRA Portal.

## Overview

As a health benefits portal handling protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII), the Kyndly ICHRA Portal must maintain the highest standards of security and privacy. This document serves as a guide for developers, administrators, and users to ensure compliance with HIPAA regulations and industry best practices.

## Compliance Requirements

### HIPAA Compliance

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) provides data privacy and security provisions for safeguarding medical information. Key requirements include:

1. **Privacy Rule**: Protects PII and PHI, restricting use and disclosure
2. **Security Rule**: Sets standards for electronic PHI security
3. **Breach Notification Rule**: Requires notification of affected individuals in case of a breach

### BAA (Business Associate Agreement)

- All third-party services processing PHI must have a signed BAA
- AWS, Auth0, and other critical service providers must be HIPAA-compliant with active BAAs

## Authentication and Authorization

### Auth0 Implementation

The Kyndly ICHRA Portal uses Auth0 for identity management with the following security measures:

1. **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - MFA is enforced for all administrator accounts
   - MFA is strongly recommended for all users

2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Admin: Full system access
   - Employer Admin: Access to their organization's data only
   - Employee: Limited access to personal information and benefits

3. **Session Management**
   - JWT tokens with appropriate expiration (60 minutes)
   - Refresh tokens with sliding expiration
   - Automatic session termination after 15 minutes of inactivity

4. **Password Policies**
   - Minimum 12 characters
   - Requires uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
   - Password rotation every 90 days
   - Previous password reuse prevention (last 12 passwords)

## API Security

1. **JWT Authentication**
   - All API requests must include a valid JWT token
   - Tokens are validated on each request

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - API endpoints are rate-limited to prevent abuse
   - Default: 100 requests per minute per IP

3. **Input Validation**
   - All inputs are validated and sanitized
   - Schema validation using Joi
   - Protection against injection attacks

4. **HTTPS/TLS**
   - All API communications use HTTPS with TLS 1.3
   - HSTS headers are enabled
   - Minimum TLS version: 1.2

## Data Security

### Encryption

1. **Data in Transit**
   - All data transmitted using TLS 1.3
   - Strong cipher suites enforced (TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256)

2. **Data at Rest**
   - Database: AWS RDS with encryption enabled (AES-256)
   - S3: Server-side encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS)
   - Encryption keys managed through AWS KMS

3. **PHI/PII Handling**
   - Sensitive data fields are encrypted at the database level
   - Tax IDs, SSNs, and other sensitive data use field-level encryption

### Data Backup and Recovery

1. **Backup Policy**
   - Automated daily backups retained for 30 days
   - Weekly backups retained for 3 months
   - Monthly backups retained for 1 year

2. **Disaster Recovery**
   - Recovery Time Objective (RTO): 4 hours
   - Recovery Point Objective (RPO): 1 hour
   - Regular disaster recovery testing (quarterly)

## Infrastructure Security

### AWS Security Configuration

1. **Network Security**
   - VPC with private and public subnets
   - Security groups with least privilege access
   - Network ACLs as additional security layer
   - VPC Flow Logs enabled for network monitoring

2. **Elastic Beanstalk Security**
   - Latest platform versions with security patches
   - Immutable deployments
   - Enhanced health reporting and monitoring

3. **S3 Security**
   - Bucket policies restricting access
   - No public access allowed
   - Versioning enabled
   - Lifecycle policies for document retention

4. **IAM Security**
   - Principle of least privilege
   - IAM roles instead of IAM users for services
   - MFA required for console access
   - Regular access key rotation

### Logging and Monitoring

1. **AWS CloudWatch**
   - Application logs
   - Performance metrics
   - Alarms for unusual activity

2. **AWS CloudTrail**
   - Tracking all API calls
   - Monitoring for unauthorized actions
   - Log file integrity validation

3. **Security Monitoring**
   - Real-time monitoring for suspicious activities
   - Automated alerts for potential security incidents
   - Integration with SIEM system (if applicable)

## Document Management Security

1. **Document Upload**
   - Virus scanning for all uploaded documents
   - File type restriction (PDF, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PNG, JPG)
   - File size limits (10MB max)

2. **Document Access**
   - Fine-grained access control
   - Document access is logged
   - Watermarking on sensitive documents

3. **Document Retention**
   - Documents retained according to compliance requirements
   - Automatic archiving based on document type
   - Secure deletion when retention period expires

## Security Development Lifecycle

1. **Secure Coding Practices**
   - Code reviews with security focus
   - Static code analysis using ESLint security plugins
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning using npm audit and Snyk

2. **Testing**
   - Regular security testing
   - Penetration testing (bi-annual)
   - Vulnerability assessments (quarterly)

3. **Incident Response**
   - Documented incident response plan
   - Defined roles and responsibilities
   - Regular tabletop exercises
   - Post-incident analysis and learning

## Employee Security Practices

1. **Access Management**
   - Just-in-time access for production systems
   - Regular access reviews
   - Immediate access revocation on termination

2. **Training**
   - Security awareness training (annual)
